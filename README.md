- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @npinak
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently using this page to show projects that I've done to employers! 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Data Science using Python, R, and MATLAB.
- ðŸ§  For my professional goals, I want to research the neural origins of psychiatric disoders. I know this is a broad topic, but I hope to learn more about what specifically I'm interested in as I gain more experience in the field of neuroscience.
